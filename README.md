# lfx-security-snyk-scm-refresh

This is a wrapper lambda for the [Snyk SCM refresh python tool](https://github.com/snyk-tech-services/snyk-scm-refresh) which cleans up the Snyk projects after a successful scan.

The Snyk SCM tool keeps Snyk projects in sync with their associated Github repos.

For repos with at least 1 project already in Snyk:

- Detect and import new manifests
- Remove projects for manifests that no longer exist
- Update projects when a repo has been renamed
- Detect and update default branch change (not renaming)
- Enable Snyk Code analysis for repos
- Detect deleted repos and log for review

## Prerequisites
Python3.7 

## Deployment

```bash
yarn deploy:dev
```

## Command Line Testing

# First: Log into your AWS account for the appropriate environment
# Second: invoke using the desired payload, ensure github_enterprise_token, one can add extra params like repo_name, org_id for 
aws --region us-east-2 lambda invoke \
